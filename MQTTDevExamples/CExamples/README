Expect mosquitto package already installed on your system

Use the Makefile to compile both publisher and subscriber code

They can also be compiled using the command below.

gcc -o mqtt_pub mqtt_pub.c -lmosquitto


When you run the publisher executable there will be a command prompt to 
input a message. That will be received at the subscriber side if 
it is running on another terminal.

Simply press Enter to quit
