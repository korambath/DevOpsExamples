######### CA Certificate Creation ####################


# The Common Name (CN) must not be the same as of clients or broker
# In most cases CN must be the same as FQDN
# openssl-genrsa, genrsa - generate an RSA private key, DES encryption

openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 2048

#  Note down the password

openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

# verify
openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text -noout
openssl rsa -in ca.key -check

########### Server Certificate Creation

# create the keys and certificates of the broker:
# generate a private key is generated (without a password):

openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

hostname
#ppk-VirtualBox

openssl req -out server.csr -key server.key -new

# Answer this question with FQDN (should not be the same as CA CN)
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: ppk-VirtualBox


# verify
openssl req -text -noout -verify -in server.csr


openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ../ca/ca.crt -CAkey ../ca/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 3285

# Commands for Client certificate is similar to the server except that CN is different.
